# Leez-rd Bot
My first larger coding project, a Discord bot that spanned about 10 months from January-October 2023. It primarily involves an idle game, very heavily inspired by [Zoo by Colon](https://gdcolon.com/zoo) where the player can catch characters from an old universe I created years prior.

This bot is full of loads of weird and wacky references to an older time, a lot of which no longer have any meaning.  I've tried to modernise some of the references, but I'm intentionally leaving some weird nonsensical things in that are completely up to your interpretation.

Please feel free to reach out on [Discord](https://derpymon.xyz/@/discord) or [Bluesky](https://derpymon.xyz/@/bsky) if you have any questions.

All user data from when the bot was active has been moved and kept safely. If you used the bot and have queries about your data, I am happy to send over or delete all of your user data from when the bot was active.
